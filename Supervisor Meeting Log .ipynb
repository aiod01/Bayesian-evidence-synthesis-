    "The spirit of multiple imputation is estimating unknown values from the relationship we could obtain from our data set, taking the uncertainty of randomness into account by imputing the values multiple times. The idea is more alike to the one of Bayesian frame. That is, from the given data set we obtain our posterior belief, then we get samples from there (posterior) and guess the missing variable of interest with uncertainty included credible interval."
